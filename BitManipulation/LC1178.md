I have an idea. Finding it difficult to write the syntax. Help me develop this logic into code!

The `.java` file will store my *ongoing* approach, as I code it( and re-code it- trials and errors)

I will explain my approach here:
___________________________
1. We have the following conditions to focus on:
  - `(bitmaskWord) & (bitmaskPuzzle)`
  - `puzzles[]` whose 1st letter is contained in `words[]` only those words are to be used for bitwise `&`, in other words, `bitmaskWords` of only those words belonging to `words[]` are to be considered which has the first letter of the `i`th element from `puzzle[]` array
___________________
2. Thus what we can do to optimize the number of comparisons required for `bitmaskWord & bitmaskpuzzle` operation is that we can create a Hash map of letters of the alphabet and each letter will map to bitmasks of words in the `words[]` array which contains the specific letter
```java
          // Letters --> Bitmask of words from words[] which contains the letter
          HashMap<Character, ArrayList<Integer>> map2 = new HashMap<>();
```
________________________
3. To make the bitmask we will need another map, which mapa letters to index in bitmask. For example, if the word contains 'a' then the 0th index of the bitmask array will be '1', similarly if the word contains 't' the '19th' index of the bitmask array will be '1'. Also if the word does not contains 'e' then the '4th' index of the bitmask of this word will be '0'
```java
          // Letters --> Index in bitmask
          HashMap<Character , Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
```
____________________
4. We use `map1` to make bitmasks for each element in the `words[]` array and `puzzles[]` 
____________________
5. For each `bitmaskPuzzle` `&` `map2.getKey(ithpuzzle.charAt(0))` this will make sure that only those `bitmaskWord` are being used for `&` that have `ithpuzzle.charAt(0)` in it, that is the first letter of each puzzle (*condition2 fulfilled*)
________________________
6. The final step will be:
```java
bistmaskPuzzle = /*loop over the length of a word from puzzle[] and match it with map1, as described earlier*/;
bitmaskWord = map2.getValue(map1.getKey(puzzle.charAt(0)));

if ((bitmaskPuzzle) & (bitmaskWord) == (bitmaskWord)) //then this is the desired matxh
```
In the above code:
- `puzzle.charAt(0)` = 1st letter of puzzle
- `map2.getKey(puzzle.charAt(0))` = letter corresponding to the `ArrayList<>` of the the `bitmaskWords` which have that `key` letter in them
- `map2.getvalue(map1.getKey(puzzle.charAt(0)))` = To be considered for `&` operation
